# Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine a good time of year to open an ice cream/surf shop in Hawaii based on weather patters for June and December.
The data source is a SQLite database file to be queried and read into a Pandas DataFrame.

# Results
Based on our analysis, June and December don't have dramatically different temperature swings between the months of June and December. The min temperature in December is 56, while it is 64 in June. Max temperatures range from 83 (December) to 85 (June).

# Summary
It appears that based on weather, the business will likely do well year-round in Hawaii. That said, they should likely choose a launch date that is in line with the bigger tourist season in Hawaii. June falls at the beginning or middle of the busier tourish season so that is likely the time to start. More queries could be run in order to better understand precipition data and humidity levels. Surf data, and water visisbility would also be good things to consider.
